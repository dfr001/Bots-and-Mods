# Bots-and-Mods

Code written to create bots for Discord, mods for games, etc. Personal projects that are all executable while remaining works in progress.

## Discord
`magic_conch_bot.py` contains code for a work in progress Discord bot that either has simple response to a text command or outputs trivia questions from a local file.

## Mods
### _Legendary: A Marvel Deck Building Game_
`Marvel_legendary_setup_script.R` is an R script that randomizes the setup for the board game _Legendary: A Marvel Deck Building Game_ and outputs text.

`legendary_script.txt` and `ui_xml.txt` are created and used to play the board game _Legendary: A Marvel Deck Building Game_ within the video game _Tabletop Simulator_. In addition to the base game, some expansions are included. The main script, `legendary_script.txt`, is written in Lua. `ui_xml.txt` is an XML script written to customeize the look of some clickable buttons.
